# TCPChatApp

This is an IRC-style chat application that works over a TCP connection. It is meant to be run as two different applications, the server and the client. The server can be run by running `python3 server.py`and the client can be run by running `python3 client_main.py`. Enjoy!

**Important**
The client as is is set up to connect to a google cloud VM insance that I created and will not be up unless I am using it. So, to use the client, you need to change the host variable in client_main.py to either 'localhost' or an ip addres for a cloud instance of the server.
